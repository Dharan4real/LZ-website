            Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The band comprised Robert Plant (vocals),
            Jimmy Page (guitar), John Paul Jones (bass and keyboards) and John Bonham (drums). With a heavy,
            guitar-driven sound and drawing from influences including blues and folk music, Led Zeppelin are cited as a
            progenitor of hard rock and heavy metal. They significantly influenced the music industry, particularly in
            the development of album-oriented rock and stadium rock.

            Page composed most of Led Zeppelin's music, while Plant wrote most of the lyrics. Jones occasionally
            contributed keyboard-focused parts, particularly on the band's final album. The latter half of their career
            saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery. Although
            they remained commercially and critically successful, their touring and output, which included Presence
            (1976) and In Through the Out Door (1979), declined in the late 1970s.

            After Bonham's death in 1980, the group disbanded. The former members have sporadically collaborated and
            participated in one-off concerts, including the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in London, with Bonham's
            son Jason Bonham on drums.

            Led Zeppelin are one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated record sales of between
            200 and 300 million units worldwide. They achieved eight consecutive UK number-one albums and six number-one
            albums on the US Billboard 200, with five of their albums certified Diamond in the US by the Recording
            Industry Association of America (RIAA). Rolling Stone described them as "the heaviest band of all time",
            "the biggest band of the seventies", and "unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history".
            They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995; the museum's biography states that they were
            "as influential" in the 1970s as the Beatles were in the 1960s.
